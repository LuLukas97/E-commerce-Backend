# E-commerce-Backend

## Backend API
To create this mock e-commerce Java and MongoDB was used. API documentation for the endpoints will be added as well as a CSV of the mock data on MongoDB.

I chose to work with MongoDB because of it's referenced documents, which helps to keep a good data consistency.
